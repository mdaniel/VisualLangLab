  <p>The terms <i>parse-tree</i> and <i>AST</i> (short for <i>Abstract Syntax Tree</i>)
  are used interchangably thoroughout the documentation to mean the same thing -- the
  structure of information gathered during the parsing process. 
  This is how <a href=
  "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree">Wikipedia defines AST</a>.</p>

  <p>The discussion below explains two related issues: how <a href=
  "http://vll.java.net/">VisualLangLab</a> determines the structure of the AST for any
  parser-rule (or grammar-tree), and how the user should design and program action-code 
  to process an AST. The same knowledge is also required when writing a custom application 
  as described in <a href="UsingTheAPI.html">Using the API</a></p>

<p>
This version (10 or higher) of <a href="http://vll.java.net/">VisualLangLab</a> is written in
Java with no other dependencies, so the AST is expressed in terms of standard Java/JVM types. 
The AST of a complete parser-rule (or grammar-tree) is built up by recursively nesting these
structures as required. Examples in the following sections illustrate this concept.
</p>

<h2 id="ASTStructure">AST Structure</h2>

<p>
The AST structure of any particular grammar-tree is determined by the
arrangement, type, multiplicity, and other attributes of its nodes. 
Starting from the root-node, the following rules are applied recursively:
</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">

<li>The <i>Root</i> node is just a passive container -- its AST is the same
as that of the contained tree</li>

<li>A <i>Literal</i> token contributes a <code>String</code> (identical to its 
pattern)</li>

<li>A <i>Regexp</i> token contributes a <code>String</code> (the portion of the input 
that matches its pattern -- often called the <i>lexeme</i>)</li>

<li>A <i>Sequence</i> contributes an object array (<code>Object[]</code>) containing 
the items contributed by its child nodes</li>

<li>A <i>Choice</i> contributes an array of two objects (<code>new Object[2])</code> 
where the first member is a <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/guide/language/autoboxing.html">boxed int</a> 
specifying the (0-based) index of the matching alternative, and the second member is the
AST contributed by the matched alternative</li>

<li>A <i>RepSep</i> contributes a <code>List&lt;Object&gt;</code> containing the ASTs 
of all the matched items</li>

<li>A <i>SemPred</i> contributes nothing to the containing element's AST</li>

</ul>

<p>Additionally, certain annotations cause the structure defined above to be modified
in the following ways:</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">

<li>A node with multiplicity <i>?</i> (0 or 1) contributes af array on one element 
(<code>new Object[1]</code>). The contained element is either an AST or <code>null</code> 
(if the node did not match the input)</li>

<li>A node with a multiplicity <i>*</i> (0-or-more) or <i>+</i> (1-or-more) wraps the
underlying values into a <code>List&lt;Object&gt;</code>. An empty list is returned if
the multiplicity is <i>*</i>, and no matching elements were found in the input</li>


<li>A node with multiplicity <i>0</i> (<i>not</i>) or <i>=</i> (<i>guard</i>)
contributes nothing to the AST</li>

<li>A child node of a <i>Sequence</i> with the <i>drop</i> annotation contributes
nothing to the AST</li>

<li>A <i>Sequence</i> with only one child that contributes to the AST (because all
other child nodes have a <i>drop</i> annotation, or have multiplicities of <i>0</i>
(not) or <i>=</i> (guard)) does not produce an array, but just
passes on the AST produced by its one contributing child node</li>

</ul>

<p>All primitive values in the AST are subject to <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/guide/language/autoboxing.html">autoboxing</a>, 
so explicit unboxing may have to be done if the language used for processing the AST does not 
know about autoboxing/unboxing. This is particularly the case when using JavaScript in action-code 
functions (see below).</p>

<p>The examples below illustrate these principles using grammar trees from the built-in
parser for <i>SimpleJSON</i>. Remember that the AST shown in the figures is the AST of
the <i>selected</i> node. Also, remember that the root-node of a grammar-tree merely
reflects the AST of the contained tree.</p>

<h3 id="AssociatingRuleTreeNodeAndASTSegment">Associating Rule-Tree Node and AST Segment</h3>

<p>
It is sometimes difficult to determine which rule-tree node 
contributed to a segment of the AST. To help with these situations, VisualLangLab 
appends the <i>description</i> field of a rule-tree node (if provided) to the AST segment 
produced for it. Figure-1 below shows an example of such tagging of portions of the AST. 
You can add a description to a rule-tree node by right-clicking the node and choosing 
<i>Description</i> from the context-menu. 
</p>

<i>Figure-1. Using description to locate node AST</i>
</p>

<h3 id="SequenceNodeExample">Sequence Node Example</h3>

<p>
Figure-2 below illustrates the AST of a Sequence node. It also shows the result of
testing the grammar-tree with some user-provided input.
</p>

<p>
<img src="images/ASTSequence.png" alt="Sequence node AST" /><br />
<i>Figure-2. Sequence node AST</i>
</p>

<p>
The text displayed under <i>Parse Tree (AST) Structure</i> (on the right of the grammar-tree) 
is the structure of the AST produced by the parser. Observe that the 
structure is an array with three elements (corresponding to the number of
child-nodes of the Sequence node). The format used for the array's elements is
described below:
</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>[stringLiteral] - this form (name of a Regex node within square brackets)
represents the lexeme matching the regular-expression</li>

<li>":" - a string within double-quotes represents the string itself</li>

<li>@Value - an <i>@</i> prefixed parser-rule (or grammar-tree) name represent the
AST returned by the named rule or tree</li>
</ul>

<p>
The panels at the bottom of the GUI are used for testing the parser. 
Some test input (<i>"count" : 55</i>) has been typed into the <i>Parser Test
Input</i> area, and the result of running the parser appears under <i>Parser Log</i>.
The AST actually generated is shown here.
</p>

<p>
As described in <a href="TestingParsers.html">Testing Parsers</a> the selected
rule-tree is run by choosing <i>Test -&gt; Parse text</i> from the main menu or by
clicking on the <i>Parse text</i> toolbar button (<img src=
"images/ToolBarButtonParseInput.gif" align="center" alt="The Parse-input button" />).
</p>

<h3 id="ChoiceNodeExample">Choice Node Example</h3>

<p>
The grammar-tree in Figure-3 below illustrates the AST of a <i>Choice</i> node.
</p>

<p>
<img src="images/ASTChoice.png" alt="Choice node AST" /><br />
<i>Figure-3. Choice node AST</i>
</p>

<p>
The display shows the structure of the AST of a Choice node.
The value actually returned by the parser is any one of the arrays 
(<code>Array(int, ...)</code>) shown. The first member of each array is the
index of the array, while the second member is the AST obtained by parsing 
the matching input text.
</p>

<p>
The testing area shows the result of parsing the text <i>3.14</i>.
The result of the run is <code>Array(3, 3.14)</code>. 
The first member of the array in this example (the value <i>3</i>) 
is the 0-based index of the matching alternative (node <i>floatingPointNumber</i>).
</p>

<h3 id="RepSepNodeExample">RepSep Node Example</h3>

<p>
The grammar-tree in Figure-4 below illustrates the AST of a <i>RepSep</i> node.
</p>

<p>
<img src="images/ASTRepSep.png" alt="RepSep node AST" /><br />
<i>Figure-4. RepSep node AST</i>
</p>

<p>
Observe the the AST in this case is a 2-level structure -- a <code>List</code>
nested within an <code>Array</code>. The <code>List</code> represents the
<i>RepSep</i>, while the <code>Array</code> represents the containing
<i>Sequence</i>.
</p>

<p>
The parser when tested with the following input: <i>[false, 3.14, "hello"]</i>
produces this AST as output: 
</p>

<pre><code>Array(
    [, 
    <span style="color: red;">List(
        <span style="color: blue;">Array(6, false)</span>, 
        <span style="color: blue;">Array(3, 3.14)</span>, 
        <span style="color: blue;">Array(2, "hello")
    </span>)</span>, 
    ]
)</code></pre>

<p>The red parts come from the <i>RepSep</i>, 
while the blue parts come from the <i>Value</i> rule   it uses. 
</p>

<h3 id="SequenceNodeWithOneContributingNode">Sequence Node Example with One Contributing Node</h3>

<p>
Our last example Figure-5 below illustrates the AST of a <i>Sequence</i> node with
just 1 contributing node. It also shows the effect of applying the <i>drop</i>
annotation to the child node of a <i>Sequence</i>.
</p>

<p>
<img src="images/ASTSeqWithDrop.png" alt="Sequence node AST with 1 contributing node" /><br />
<i>Figure-5. Sequence node AST with 1 contributing node</i>
</p>

<p>
This example uses the same grammar-tree as the previous example, but applies the
<i>drop</i> annotation to the Literal nodes <i>LBKT</i> and <i>RBKT</i> (see <a href=
"EditingTheGrammarTree.html">Editing the Grammar Tree</a>). The presence of the
attribute is clearly evident in the grammar tree from the textual annotation as well as
the overlay applied to the basic Literal icon.
</p>

<p>
The AST changes drastically beacuse of these modifications. The two <i>drop</i>ped
nodes do not appear in the AST. And, since the Sequence has just one child node left
that contributes to the AST (the RepSep), the Sequence merely passes on the AST of the
RepSep. It does not need to produce an <code>Array</code>.
</p>

<h2 id="ActionCodeDesign">Action-Code Design</h2>

<p>
Action-code in <a href="http://vll.java.net/">VisualLangLab</a> is an anonymous
JavaScript function associated with any rule-tree node. 
The code is interpreted by the JVM's embedded Javascript engine 
(<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/">Rhino</a>), and can therefore 
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/ScriptingJava.html">use the JDK API</a>. 
This section assumes that the reader understands JavaScript reasonably well.
</p>

<h3 id="CodeStructureAndInvocation">Code Structure and Invocation</h3>

<p>
An action-code function takes one argument that is used in two different ways 
(explained below). The value returned by the function depends on the overall 
design of the parser, but in general should be an object that becomes a part of 
the AST of the parent parser-node. If nothing is returned by any code branch 
of the action function, <code>null</code> is assumed to have been returned.
</p>

<p>
An action-code function is called twice by the parser: first (unconditionally) 
before parsing of the associated node begins, 
and second (conditionally) after parsing of the node has ended successfully. 
The first invocation allows the function to perform any setup actions, 
while the second invocation is intended for AST processing. 
The action-code function can distinguish the 
two invocations by testing the value of its argument. 
The argument is <i>null</i> during the first invocation, 
but contains a valid AST (necessarily non-null) during the second invocation. 
Action-code functions must test the argument's value and act accordingly.
</p>

<p>
A simple example of the use of action-code functions can be seen in the 
sample grammar <i>PS2E-ArithExpr-Action</i>. Figure-6 below shows one such 
action-code function. Observe that a rule-tree node with with associate 
action-code has the <i>action</i> annotation near the icon (see red arrow 
in the figure). From Version 10.21, the toolbar's dropdown for rule-names 
also places a small green arrow-icon (as in Figure-6) near the name of each 
rules that includes any action functions.
The sample grammar <i>PSWP-Payroll-Parser-Combinators</i> 
has a more extensive example that includes setup (null-argument invocations) 
as well.
</p>

<p>All primitive values in the AST are subject to <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/guide/language/autoboxing.html">autoboxing</a>, 
so explicit unboxing has to be done as JavaScript does not know about this Java concept. 
</p>

<p>
<img src="images/Action-Code-Example.png" alt="Action code example" /><br />
<i>Figure-6. Action code example</i>
</p>

<p>
To add an action-code function to any rule-tree node, select the node, then 
type or paste the code into the panel under <i>Action Code</i>, and click the 
<i>Save</i> button below the panel. The button is enabled whenever the text 
in the panel is changed.
</p>

<h3 id="PredefinedVariables">Predefined Variables</h3>

<p>
To facilitate the design of stateful behavior, and provide access to
environmental information, action-code functions can use certain
predefined global variables. These are listed and described in Table-1
below.
</p>

<i>Table-1. Predefined global variables</i>

  <table border="1" style="border: 1px solid black;">
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Name</th>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td align="center"><code>vllCol</code></td>
      <td>The column number of the input position at which <strike>the action-code 
          function is called</strike> <u>the text in <i>vllInput</i> is found

          The value is a

    </tr>
    <tr>

    </tr>
    <tr>

      <td>The offset of the input position at which the action-code 
          function is called.

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td align="center"><code>vllSource</code></td>
      <td>The entire source text presented to the parser as a

    </tr>


    <tr>
      <td align="center"><code>vllLastNoSuccess</code></td>
      <td>The Last NoSuccess object created by the parser</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td align="center"><code>vllParserTestInput</code></td>
      <td>The GUI's <code>JTextComponent</code> containing user-provided test input 
        (just under the <i>Parser Test Input</i> label)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td align="center"><code>vllParserLog</code></td>
      <td>The GUI's <code>JTextComponent</code> containing parser log text 
        (just under the <i>Parser Log</i> label)</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

<p>
The last two variables above (<i>vllParserTestInput</i>, and <i>vllParserLog</i>) 
are useful for writing automated test scripts as described in 
<a  href="TestingParsers.html#WrapperWithActionCode">Wrapper with Action Code</a>.
</p>

<h3 id="UseOfVLLAsGlobalContainerVariable">Use of VLL as Global Container Variable</h3>

<p>
Many action-code functions can be stateless, merely modifying the AST passed in 
on the fly. But the need to use and manage global state can be unavoidable in certain 
other applications. For these cases, it is suggested that the a global variable named VLL 
be used to house all state information. VLL can be set up either as a map or a stack 
(see sample grammar <i>PSWP-Payroll-Parser-Combinators</i> for an example). 
A consistently used naming convention and coding pattern will lead to error-free and 
maintainable parsers/translators.
