<p>
In the world of computing a <i>grammar</i> is a somewhat different thing from the object implied in <i>grammar without tears</i>. But in terms of the misery caused to those who have to deal with them, the two grammars are closely related. This article describes a no tears approach to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parser">parser</a> development using <a href="http://vll.java.net">VisualLangLab</a>, a free open-source parser-generator. VisualLangLab has an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment">IDE</a> that represents grammar rules (or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-down_parsing">productions</a>) as intuitive trees, like those in Figure-1 below, without code or scripts of any kind. 
</p>

<p id="Figure1">
<img src="images/grammar-tree-examples.png" alt="VisualLangLab's grammar-trees" /><br />
<em>Figure 1. VisualLangLab's grammar-trees</em>
</p>

<p>
These grammar-trees are also <i>executable</i>, and can be run at the click of a button. This encourages the use of tight <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_and_incremental_development">iterative-incremental</a> development cycles, and greatly improves the pace of development. These features also make it an effective prototyping environment and a training tool.
</p>

<p>
Parsing techniques and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parser_generator">parser generators</a> are a great addition to any developer's arsenal, and VisualLangLab provides a convenient, gentle introduction to those topics. A later article will describe the use of VisualLangLab to produce a <i>domain specific language</i> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language">DSL</a> for testing Java-Swing programs. 
</p>

<h3 id="GeneratedCode">Can I see the Generated Code?</h3>

<p>
All other parser-generators produce code that you must compile and link with your application code. This leads to two difficulties: users must be fairly proficient programmers, and the application itself must be written in the same language as the tool-generated code. VisualLangLab circumvents both these issues by not generating code. 
</p>

<p>
The secret ingredient of VisualLangLab parsers is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parser_combinator">parser combinator</a> functions. It uses them to turn grammar-trees <i>directly</i> into a parser at run-time without needing to generate or compile source-code. But users do not have to know anything about combinators to use these capabilities, and the parsers produced can be used in application programs written in <i>any</i> JVM language. 
</p>

<h3 id="DownloadAndRun">Download and Run VisualLangLab</h3>

<p>
You can find instructions for downloading and running VisualLangLab online at <a href="http://vll.java.net/DownloadInstallAndRun.html">Download, Install, and Run</a>. 
</p>

<h3 id="TheGUI">The GUI</h3>

<p>
When started, VisualLangLab displays the GUI shown in Figure-2 below. The article explains the menus and buttons as needed, but a full description can also be found online at <a href="http://vll.java.net/TheGUI.html">The GUI</a>. All toolbar buttons have tool-tip texts that explain their use. 
</p>

<p id="Figure2">
<img src="images/GuiFull3.png" alt="The VisualLangLab GUI" /><br />
<em>Figure 2. The VisualLangLab GUI</em>
</p>

<p>
The five panels (labeled A thru E) are used as described below.
</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>A displays the grammar-tree as described in <a href="#ManagingRules">Managing Rules</a> below</li>
<li>B displays the <a href="#TheParseTree">AST structure</a> of the selected grammar-tree node</li>
<li>C is where the selected node's <a href="#ActionCode">action code</a> is displayed. If this appears to break the <i>no code, no script</i> promise, rest assured that action-code is always optional</li>
<li>D and E are used for <a href="#TestingYourParser">testing the parser</a> as described below</li>
</ul>

<p>
The following sections are a tutorial introduction that lead you through the steps of creating a simple parser. 
</p>

<h3 id="ManagingTokens">Managing Tokens</h3>

<p>
VisualLangLab supports two kinds of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_analysis#Token">token</a>, <i>literal</i> and <i>regex</i>, that the following discussion and examples will help you differentiate. We create 2 literals and 1 regex that are used in a rule later.
</p>

<h4 id="LiteralTokenCreation">Literal Token Creation</h4>

<p>
In the following description we create two literal tokens to match the text "+" and "-" respectively (without the quote marks).
</p>

<p>
To create the first token select <i>Tokens -> New literal</i> from the main menu (left of Figure-3 below). Enter the literal's pattern (<i>+</i>) into the dialog box presented, and click the <i>OK</i> button. This creates a token with the same name as the pattern (enclosed in quote marks). A token's name is used to refer to it from rules, while the pattern describes its contents.
</p>

<p>
Now create the second <i>literal</i> token with <i>-</i> as the pattern (right of Figure-3). 
</p>

<p>
<img src="images/literal-creation.png" alt="Creating a literal token" /><br />
<em>Figure 3. Creating a literal token</em>
</p>

<p>
Literal tokens named after their text-pattern are convenient and intuitive in use. But there are cases where a name different from the pattern is needed. For these cases, you should enter the token's name and its pattern (space-separated) into the dialog.
</p>

<h4 id="RegexTokenCreation">Regex Token Creation</h4>

<p>
Figure-4 below shows how you can create a <i>regex</i> token. Select <i>Tokens -> New regex</i> from the main menu, and enter the token's name (<i>NUMBER</i>), a space, and the pattern (<i>\\d+</i>) into the dialog box and click <i>OK</i>. You probably recognize the pattern as a Java <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html">regular-expression</a> that matches numbers.
</p>

<p>
<img src="images/regex-creation.png" alt="Creating a regex token" /><br />
<em>Figure 4. Creating a regex token</em>
</p>

<p>
It is conventional to assign user-chosen names to regex tokens, but VisualLangLab also allows you to skip the user-specified name, allowing the default name ("\\d+" for the example above) to be assigned instead.
</p>

<p>
Observe that the pattern part in the dialogs above (for literal as well as regex tokens) should be written exactly as if they were inside a literal <i>String</i> in a Java program.
</p>

<p>
There is not a great deal more to tokens, but if you would like to read the fine print, check out the last part of <a href="http://vll.java.net/EditingTheGrammarTree.html">Editing the Grammar Tree</a>. 
</p>

<h4>Miscellaneous Token Operations</h4>

<p>
The main menu and toolbar also support several other operations. You can find which rules use any particular token (<i>Tokens -> Find token</i>), edit tokens (<i>Tokens -> Edit token</i>), and delete unused tokens (<i>Tokens -> Delete token</i>). 
</p>

<h4>Whitespace and Comments</h4>

<p>
You can specify the character patterns that separate adjacent tokens by invoking <i>Globals -> Whitespace</i> from the main menu, and entering a regular expression into the popped up dialog box. The default whitespace specification is "\\s+".
</p>

<p>
You can also provide a regular expression for recognizing comments in the input text. Select <i>Globals -> Comment</i> from the main menu, and enter a regular expression into the dialog box. There is no default value for this parameter.
</p>

<h4>Token Libraries</h4>

<p>
Tokens tend to be reused within application domains, so VisualLangLab allows you to create and use token libraries. These operations are invoked from the main menu by selecting <i>Tokens -> Import tokens</i> and <i>Tokens -> Export tokens</i>, or by using corresponding toolbar buttons. 
</p>

<h3 id="ManagingRules">Managing Rules</h3>

<p>
VisualLangLab represents rules as grammar-trees with intuitive icons (see <a href="#Figure1">Figure-1</a> above) and a context-sensitive popup-menu. This graphical depiction makes grammars comprehensible to a wider range of users. The icons and textual annotations used are described below.
</p>

<h4 id="NodeIcons">Node Icons</h4>

<p>
The table below describes the icons used in the grammar-trees.
</p>

<table border="1" style="border: 1px solid black;">
  <tr><td colspan="2" align="center"><b>Non-terminals</b></td></tr>
  <tr><td><img src="images/GrammarIconRoot.gif" alt="The Root icon" /></td><td>Root - used for the root node of every grammar tree</td></tr>
  <tr><td><img src="images/GrammarIconChoice.gif" alt="The Choice icon" /></td><td>Choice - used as the parent of a group of alternatives</td></tr>
  <tr><td><img src="images/GrammarIconSequence.gif" alt="The Sequence icon" /></td><td>Sequence - used as the parent of a sequence of items</td></tr>
  <tr><td><img src="images/GrammarIconRepSep.gif" alt="The RepSep icon" /></td><td>RepSep - parent of a sequence of similar items that also uses a specified separator</td></tr>
  <tr><td><img src="images/GrammarIconReference.gif" alt="The Reference icon" /></td><td>Reference - invokes another named parser</td></tr>
  <tr><td colspan="2" align="center"><b>Terminals</b></td></tr>
  <tr><td><img src="images/GrammarIconLiteral.gif" alt="The Literal icon" /></td><td>Literal - matches a specified literal token</td></tr>
  <tr><td><img src="images/GrammarIconRegex.gif" alt="The Regex icon" /></td><td>Regexp - matches a specified regex token</td></tr>
  <tr><td colspan="2" align="center"><b>Utility nodes & Icon overlays</b></td></tr>
  <tr><td><img src="images/GrammarIconWildCard.gif" alt="The WildCard icon" /></td><td>Token wildcard - a pseudo-token that matches any other defined token, useful for error handling strategies</td></tr>
  <tr><td><img src="images/GrammarIconSemPred.gif" alt="The SemPred icon" /></td><td>Semantic predicate - succeeds or fails depending on the run-time value of an expression</td></tr>
  <tr><td><img src="images/GrammarIconCommitMark.gif" alt="The Commit-mark icon" /></td><td>Commit - displayed on top of a node that has the <i>commit</i> annotation</td></tr>
  <tr><td><img src="images/GrammarIconErrorMark.gif" alt="The Error-mark icon" /></td><td>Error: indicates an error in the associated node or rule</td></tr>
</table>

<h4>Node Annotations</h4>

<p>
Each grammar-tree node has characteristics (such as multiplicity) that are represented as <i>annotations</i> displayed as text beside the icon. You can change a node's annotations by right-clicking the node and choosing the required settings from the context-menu (see Figure-5 below).
</p>

<p>
<img src="images/setting-annotations.png" alt="Setting node annotations" /><br />
<em>Figure 5. Setting node annotations</em>
</p>

<p>
The first annotation, a 1-character flag, indicates the node's <i>multiplicity</i> -- the number of times the corresponding entity may occur in the parser's input. You can see examples of its use everywhere in the built-in <a href="#SampleGrammars">Sample Grammars</a>. Multiplicity has one of the following values:
</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>1 - exactly one occurrence</li>
<li>? - 0 or 1 occurrence</li>
<li>* - 0 or more occurrences</li>
<li>+ - 1 or more occurrences</li>
<li>0 - the associated entity must <i>not</i> occur in the input (but see note below)</li>
<li>= - the associated entity <i>must</i> occur in the input (but see note below)</li>
</ul>

<p>
<u>Note</u>: The last two settings ("0" and "=") are used to implement <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_predicate">syntactic predicates</a> and have no influence on the information gathered by the parser (into to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree">AST</a> or parse-tree). These settings are called <i>not</i> and <i>guard</i> respectively, using names inspired by functions of the same name in the Scala Parser combinator <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/util/parsing/combinator/Parsers.html"> library</a> class.
</p>

<p>
The second annotation is the <i>name</i> of the entity. The value displayed depends on the type of the node as described below. (The remaining icon types do not have a <i>name</i>)
</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Root - the name of the parser-rule itself</li>
<li>Literal - the name of the literal token</li>
<li>Regexp - the name of the regular-expression token</li>
<li>Reference - the name of referred-to parser-rule</li>
</ul>

<p>
The remaining annotations, described below, are optional. If any of the optional annotations are present, they are enclosed within square brackets.
</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>commit - backtracking to optional parser clauses (at an upper level) will be prevented if this node is successfully parsed</li>
<li>drop - the node will not be entered into the AST. You can see examples in the built-in <i>ArithExpr</i> <a href="SampleGrammars.html">Sample Grammars</a></li>
<li>message - the node has an associated error-message</li>
<li>packrat - the parser-rule is a <a href="http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/~baford/packrat/thesis/">packrat parser</a> (applicable only to a root-node)</li>
<li>trace - the parser's use of the node will be logged at run-time</li>
</ul>

<p>
All node attributes can be changed via the context menu shown in Figure-5 above.
</p>

<p>
Finally, if the node has a <i>description</i>, it is displayed last within parenthesis.
</p>

<h4>Creating Rules</h4>

<p>
When VisualLangLab is started, it automatically creates a new rule named <i>Main</i>. More rules can be created by selecting <i>Rules -> New rule</i> from the main menu and entering the rule's name into the popped-up dialog. A newly created rule contains just the Root node. The root's context menu can be used as described below to edit the rule as needed.
</p>

<h4>Editing Rules</h4>

<p>
The grammar-tree popup menu is the tool used for creating and editing grammar-trees, and is described fully in <a href="http://vll.java.net/EditingTheGrammarTree.html">Editing the Grammar Tree</a>. In the following example we get our feet just a little wet by composing a simple rule with the tokens we created above. 
</p>

<p>
First, add a <i>Sequence</i> node to the grammar-tree by right-clicking the root node (<img src="images/GrammarIconRoot.gif" align="center" alt="The Root icon" />) and selecting <i>Add -> Sequence</i> from the popup menu as shown on the left side of Figure-6 below. A sequence icon (<img src="images/GrammarIconSequence.gif" align="center" alt="The Sequence icon" />) is added to the root, as on the right of the figure.
</p>

<p>
<img src="images/add-sequence.png" alt="Adding a sequence node" /><br />
<em>Figure 6. Adding a sequence node</em>
</p>

<p>
Then perform the following steps:
</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>right-click the newly added sequence node (<img src="images/GrammarIconSequence.gif" align="center" alt="The Sequence icon" />) and select <i>Add -> Token</i>. This will bring up a dialog containing a list of token names. Select <i>NUMBER</i> and click the dialog's <i>OK</i> button. A regex icon (<img src="images/GrammarIconRegex.gif" align="center" alt="The Regex icon" />) is added to the sequence node</li> 
<li>right-click the sequence node again and select <i>Add -> Choice</i> from the popup menu. This should add a <i>Choice</i> node icon (<img src="images/GrammarIconChoice.gif" align="center" alt="The Choice icon" />) to the sequence node</li>
<li>right-click the newly created choice node (<img src="images/GrammarIconChoice.gif" align="center" alt="The Choice icon" />) and select <i>Add -> Token</i>. Select <i>"+"</i> in the dialog box and click <i>OK</i>. A literal icon (<img src="images/GrammarIconLiteral.gif" align="center" alt="The Literal icon" />) is added to the choice node. Repeat this action once more, and add the <i>"-"</i> token to the choice node</li> 
<li>repeat the first step above to add another <i>NUMBER</i> to the sequence node</li>
</ul>

<p>
You're done! If your parser does not look like the one in Figure-7 below, use <i>Edit</i> from the grammar-tree's context menu to make the required changes. 
</p>

<p>
<img src="images/first-parser.png" alt="Your first visual parser" /><br />
<em>Figure 7. Your first visual parser</em>
</p>

<p>
The text displayed in the panel to the right of the grammar-tree is the <a href="#TheParseTree">AST</a> of the <i>selected</i> node, and so depends on which icon you clicked last. To see the AST of the complete rule, as seen in Figure-7, select (click on) the root node. 
</p>

<h4>Miscellaneous Rule Operations</h4>

<p>
The main menu and toolbar also support several other operations. You can find which other rules refer any particular rule (<i>Rules -> Find rule</i>), rename rules (<i>Rules -> Rename rule</i>), and delete unused rules (<i>Rules -> Delete rule</i>). 
</p>

<h4 id="SavingTheGrammar">Saving the Grammar</h4>

<p>
A grammar can be saved to a file by invoking <i>File -> Save</i> from the main menu. Grammars are stored in XML files with a <i>.vll</i> suffix. The contained XML captures the structure of the rules, the token definitions, and other details, but no generated information of any kind. The XML is quite intuitive and you can use XSLT or a similar technology to transform it into another format (a grammar for another tool, or code of some sort, for example) if required.
</p>

<p>
A saved grammar can be read back into the GUI by invoking <i>File -> Open</i> from the main menu. This is useful for review the grammar, further editing, or testing. An application program in any JVM language can also <a href="#UsingTheAPI">Use The API</a> to load a saved grammar and regenerate the parser (as an instance of an API-defined class). 
</p>

<h3 id="TestingYourParser">Testing your Parser</h3>

<p>
Testing is really easy, you don't have to write any code, use any other tools, or acquire any other skills:
</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>key in the test input under <i>Parser Test Input</i> ("A" in Figure-8 below)</li> 
<li>click the <i>Parse input</i> button (pointed to by the red arrow at "B")</li> 
<li>validate output that appears under <i>Parser Log</i> ("C" in the figure)</li>
</ul>

<p> 
A successful parse is indicated by the appearance of black text under <i>Parser Log</i>. Error messages are rendered in red.
</p>

<p>
<img src="images/testing-parser.png" alt="Testing your parser" /><br />
<em>Figure 8. Testing your parser</em>
</p>

<p>
The figure shows the result of testing with "3 + 5" as the input. The <i>Parser Log</i> area should contain the following text:
</p>

<pre><code>Array(3, Array(0, +), 5)</code></pre>

<p>
The result is an <a href="#TheParseTree">AST</a> with the structure shown under <i>Parse Tree (AST) Structure</i>. Since the test input entered was "3 + 5", we <i>know</i> that the result is correct. However, real-life parsers are too complex for manual testing, so VisualLangLab supports several approaches to automated testing that are described online in <a href="http://vll.java.net/TestingParsers.html">Testing Parsers</a>. 
</p>

<p>
That brings us to the end of this quick example. If you feel that the result of parsing "3 + 5" should be 8 instead of <code>Array(3, Pair(0, +), 5)</code> check out the section <i>PS2E-ArithExpr-Action Parser</i> in <a href="http://vll.java.net/SampleGrammars.html">Sample Grammars</a>.
</p>

<h3 id="AdvancedFeatures">Advanced Features</h3>

<p>
The following sections briefly describe advanced (but essential) features that are beyond the scope of this article.
</p>

<h4 id="TheParseTree">The Parse-Tree (or AST)</h4>

<p>
The terms <i>parse-tree</i> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree">Abstract Syntax Tree</a> (or just <i>AST</i>) often are used interchangeably to mean the structure of information gathered during the parsing process. Unlike other tools, VisualLangLab parsers always define and produce an AST. The AST structure is based on the arrangement and properties of the rule-tree nodes, and is displayed in the text area under <i>Parse Tree (AST) Structure</i> (see Figure-8 above). Details about the structure of VisualLangLab ASTs can be found online at <a href="http://vll.java.net/ASTAndActionCode.html">AST and Action Code</a>.
</p>

<h4 id="ActionCode">Action Code</h4>

<p>
Action-code (or just <i>actions</i>) are JavaScript functions used to transform a node's AST on the fly. Action functions are optionally entered at the text area under <i>Action Code</i> ("C" in <a href="#Figure2">Figure-2</a> above). You can see examples of action-code in the <i>PS2E-ArithExpr-Action</i> <a href="#SampleGrammars">sample grammar</a>, and more details can be found online at <a href="http://vll.java.net/ASTAndActionCode.html">AST and Action Code</a>.
</p>

<h4 id="UsingTheAPI">Using the API</h4>

<p>
The API enables applications written in any JVM language to use parsers created with VisualLangLab. The API is quite small and simple, containing definitions for the few classes required to perform the following operations.
</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>load a parser from a <a href="#SavingTheGrammar">saved grammar-file</a></li>
<li>parse a string using the parser</li>
<li>test the result, and retrieve the AST or error information</li>
</ul>

<p>
More details and examples can be found online at <a href="http://vll.java.net/UsingTheAPI.html">Using the API</a>. 
</p>

<h3 id="SampleGrammars">Sample Grammars</h3>

<p>
To enable users to quickly gain hands-on experience, VisualLangLab contains some built-in sample grammars. These samples can be reviewed, tested, modified, and saved just like any other grammar created from scratch. To open a sample grammar select <i>Help -> Sample grammars</i> from the main menu, and choose any of the samples displayed (see Figure-9 below).
</p>

<p>
<img src="images/SampleGrammar1.png" alt="Sample grammars available" /><br />

<p>
More information about these samples can be found online at <a href="http://vll.java.net/SampleGrammars.html">Sample Grammars</a>. 
</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>
The article introduces readers to parser development using the completely visual tool <a href="http://vll.java.net/">VisualLangLab</a>. Its features make it an effective prototyping environment and a training tool, and will hopefully be a useful addition to any developer's skills.
