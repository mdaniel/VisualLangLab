<p>
In the world of computing a grammar is a somewhat different thing 
from the object implied in 
<a href="http://www.google.co.in/search?sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=%22grammar+without+tears%22">grammar without tears</a>. 
But in terms of the misery caused to those 
who have to deal with them, the two grammars appear to be closely related.
This article describes a no tears approach to parser development 
using the free, open-source parser-generator <a href="http://vll.java.net">VisualLangLab</a>. 
It has an 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment">IDE</a> that represents grammar rules 
(or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-down_parsing">productions</a>) 
as intuitive trees, like those in Figure-1 below, 
without code or scripts of any kind. 
</p>

<p id="Figure1">
<img src="images/grammar-tree-examples.png" /><br/>
<em>Figure 1. VisualLangLab's grammar-trees</em>
</p>

<p>
The grammar-trees are also <i>executable</i>, and can be run directly 
at the click of a button. 
This encourages the use of tight 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_and_incremental_development">iterative-incremental</a> 
development cycles, and improves the pace of development manyfold. 
These features also make it an effective prototyping environment and a training tool.
</p>

<p>
VisualLangLab is itself written in 
<a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a>, a 
JVM language that supports object-orientation as well as 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming">functional-programming</a>, 
but you don't have to know much Scala to use VisualLangLab.
</p>

<p>
Parsing techniques and parser-generator tools are a great addition 
to any developer's arsenal, 
and VisualLangLab provides a convenient, gentle introduction to those topics. 
A later article will describe the use of VisualLangLab to produce 
a <i>domain specific language</i> or 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language">DSL</a> 
for testing Java-Swing programs. 
</p>

<h3 id="GeneratedCode">Can I see the Generated Code?</h3>

<p>
As a now-famous panda discovered, powerful recipes sometimes have 
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0441773/quotes?qt0448742">no secret ingredient</a>. 
And there is no generated code.
</p>

<p>
VisualLangLab uses Scala's parser 
<a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/util/parsing/combinator/Parsers.html">combinator</a> 
functions to turn grammar-trees (or XML from a 
<a href="#SavingTheGrammar">saved grammar-file</a>) directly into a 
<a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/util/parsing/combinator/Parsers$Parser.html">parser</a> 
at run-time without producing or compiling source-code. 
But users of the <a href="#TheGUI">GUI</a> and the <a href="#UsingTheAPI">API</a> 
do not have to know anything about combinators to use these capabilities. 
</p>

<h3 id="DownloadAndRun">Download and Run VisualLangLab</h3>

<p>
The VisualLangLab <a href="http://vll.java.net/">web-site</a> has a 
<a href="http://java.net/projects/vll/downloads/download/VLLS.zip">zip file</a> 
that includes everything you need. The only prerequisite is a 1.6+ JDK or JRE. 
To run the tool, proceed as follows.
</p>

<h4>No Scala Installation</h4>

<p>
A Scala installation is not a mandatory prerequisite. 
If you do not have Scala (or just want to avoid version issues), 
download the executable JAR file 
<a href="http://java.net/projects/vll/downloads/download/VLLS-All.jar">VLLS-All.jar</a> 
(which bundles the required Scala libraries). 
VisualLangLab is started by double-clicking <i>VLLS-All.jar</i> 
in a file browser, or by issuing the following command at a system prompt: 
</p>

<pre><code>    java -jar VLL-All.jar</code></pre>

<p>
Linux or UNIX users will, of course, have to enable execution (<code>chmod +x ...</code>) 
to have it start by double-clicking. 
</p>

<h4>Have a Scala Installation</h4>

<p>
To run VisualLangLab with your installed version of Scala 
use one of the launchers included in the zip file 
(<i>vlls.bat</i> for Windows, <i>vlls</i> for Linux).
Linux or UNIX users will need to enable execution (<code>chmod +x ...</code>) 
of the launcher script. 
</p>

<h3 id="TheGUI">The GUI</h3>

<p>
When started, VisualLangLab displays the GUI shown in Figure-2 below. 
The article explains the menus and buttons as needed, but a full 
description can also be found online at 
<a href="http://vll.java.net/TheGUI.html">The GUI</a> and in the download zip. 
All toolbar buttons have tool-tip texts that explain their use. 
</p>

<p id="Figure2">
<img src="images/vll-gui.png" /><br/>
<em>Figure 2. The VisualLangLab GUI</em>
</p>

<p>
The graphical and text panels are used as described below.
</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
  <li>A is used for the grammar-tree as described in 
      <a href="#ManagingRules">Managing Rules</a> below</li>
  <li>B displays the <a href="#TheParseTree">AST structure</a> 
      of the selected grammar-tree node</li>
  <li>C is where the selected node's <a href="#ActionCode">action code</a> 
      is displayed and edited. If this appears to break the 
      <i>no code, no script</i> promise, rest assured that action-code 
      is always optional</li>
  <li>D and E are used for <a href="#TestingYourParser">testing the parser</a> 
      as described below</li>
</ul>

<p>
The following sections are a tutorial introduction that lead you through the 
steps of creating a simple parser. 
</p>

<h3 id="ManagingTokens">Managing Tokens</h3>

<p>
There are two kinds of token, <i>literal</i> and <i>regex</i>, that 
the following discussion and examples will help you differentiate. 
We create 2 literals and 1 regex that are 
<a href="#ManagingRules">used in a rule</a> later.
</p>

<h4>Literal Token Creation</h4>

<p>
To create a literal token select <i>Tokens -> New literal</i> from the main 
menu as in Figure-3 below. Enter the literal's name (<i>PLUS</i>), 
a comma, and the pattern (<i>+</i>) into the popped up dialog box and click 
the <i>OK</i> button. 
A token's name is used to refer to it from 
rules, while the pattern describes its contents. 
All instances of a particular literal token (during the parser's run) 
have the same fixed content.
</p>

<p>
Now create another <i>literal</i> token 
named <i>MINUS</i> with a <i>-</i> pattern (as in the second dialog box 
in Figure-3). 
</p>

<p>
<img src="images/literal-creation.png" /><br/>
<em>Figure 3. Creating a literal token</em>
</p>

<h4>Regex Token Creation</h4>

<p>
Figure-4 below shows how you can create a <i>regex</i> token. 
Select <i>Tokens -> New regex</i> from the main menu, 
and enter the token's name (<i>NUMBER</i>), a comma, and the 
pattern (<i>\\d+</i>) into the dialog box and click <i>OK</i>. 
You probably recognize the pattern as a Java  
<a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html">regular-expression</a> 
that matches numbers.
</p>

<p>
<img src="images/regex-creation.png" /><br/>
<em>Figure 4. Creating a regex token</em>
</p>

<p>
Observe that the pattern part in the dialogs above (for literal as well as regex tokens) 
should be written exactly as if they were inside a <i>String</i> in a Java program 
(without the surrounding quote marks).
</p>

<p>
There is not a great deal more to tokens, but if you would like to read the 
fine print, check out the last part of 
<a href="http://vll.java.net/EditingTheGrammarTree.html">Editing the Grammar Tree</a>. 
</p>

<h4>Miscellaneous Token Operations</h4>

<p>
The main menu and toolbar also support several other operations. You can find which 
rules use any particular token (<i>Tokens -> Find token</i>), 
edit tokens (<i>Tokens -> Edit token</i>), and delete unused tokens (<i>Tokens -> Delete token</i>). 
</p>

<h4>Token Libraries</h4>

<p>
Tokens tend to be reused within application domains, so VisualLangLab allows you to 
create and use token libraries. These operations are invoked from the main menu 
by selecting <i>Tokens -> Import tokens</i> and <i>Tokens -> Export tokens</i>, 
or by using corresponding toolbar buttons. 
</p>

<h4>Whitespace and Comments</h4>

<p>
You can specify the character patterns that separate adjacent tokens by invoking 
<i>Globals -> Whitespace</i> from the main menu, and entering a regular expression 
into the popped up dialog box. The default whitespace specification is "\\s+".
</p>

<p>
You can also provide a regular expression for recognizing comments in the input text. 
Select <i>Globals -> Comment</i> from the main menu, and enter a regular expression 
into the dialog box. There is no default value for this parameter.
</p>

<h3 id="ManagingRules">Managing Rules</h3>

<p>
VisualLangLab represents rules as grammar-trees with distinctive icons 
(as in <a href="#Figure1">Figure-1</a> above) and 
a context-sensitive popup-menu. 
This graphical depiction makes grammars comprehensible to a wider range of users. 
The icons and textual annotations used in the grammar-trees are described below.
</p>

<h4>Node Icons</h4>

<p>
The table below lists the icons from which grammar-trees are constructed.
</p>

<table border="1" style="border: 1px solid black;">
  <tr><td colspan="2" align="center"><b>Non-terminals</b></td></tr>
  <tr><td><img src="images/GrammarIconRoot.gif"/></td><td>Root - used for the root 
      node of every grammar tree</td></tr>
  <tr><td><img src="images/GrammarIconChoice.gif"/></td><td>Choice - used as the parent of a group 
      of alternative items (any one of which occurs in the input)</td></tr>
  <tr><td><img src="images/GrammarIconSequence.gif"/></td><td>Sequence - used as the parent of a 
      sequence of items which occur in the order specified</td></tr>
  <tr><td><img src="images/GrammarIconRepSep.gif"/></td><td>RepSep - parent of a sequence 
      of similar items that also uses a specified separator</td></tr>
  <tr><td><img src="images/GrammarIconReference.gif"/></td><td>Reference - invokes another 
      named parser</td></tr>
  <tr><td><img src="images/GrammarIconSemPred.gif"/></td><td>Semantic predicate - 
      succeeds or fails depending on the run-time value of an expression</td></tr>
  <tr><td colspan="2" align="center"><b>Terminals</b></td></tr>
  <tr><td><img src="images/GrammarIconLiteral.gif"/></td><td>Literal - matches a 
      specified literal token</td></tr>
  <tr><td><img src="images/GrammarIconRegex.gif"/></td><td>Regexp - matches a 
      specified regex token</td></tr>
  <tr><td colspan="2" align="center"><b>Icon overlays</b></td></tr>
  <tr><td><img src="images/GrammarIconCommitMark.gif"/></td><td>Commit - displayed on top 
      of a node that has the <i>commit</i> annotation</td></tr>
  <tr><td><img src="images/GrammarIconErrorMark.gif"/></td><td>Error: indicates an error 
      in the associated node or rule</td></tr>
</table>

<h4>Node Annotations</h4>

<p>
Each grammar-tree node has characteristics (such as multiplicity) that are 
represented as the node's <i>annotations</i>, and 
are displayed as text beside each node's icon. You can change a node's 
annotations by right-clicking the node and choosing the required settings 
from the context-menu as in Figure-5 below.
</p>

<p>
<img src="images/setting-annotations.png" /><br/>
<em>Figure 5. Setting node annotations</em>
</p>

<p>
The first annotation is a 1-character flag that indicates the node's <i>multiplicity</i> 
-- the number of times the corresponding entity may occur in the parser's input. 
You can see examples of its use everywhere in the built-in 
<a href="#SampleGrammars">Sample Grammars</a>.
Multiplicity has one of the following values:
</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
  <li>1 - exactly one occurrence</li>
  <li>? - 0 or 1 occurrence</li>
  <li>* - 0 or more occurrences</li>
  <li>+ - 1 or more occurrences</li>
  <li>0 - the associated entity must <i>not</i> occur in the input (but see note below)</li>
  <li>= - the associated entity <i>must</i> occur in the input (but see note below)</li>
</ul>

<p>
<u>Note</u>: Observe that the last two values ("0" and "=") are actually commonly required 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_predicate">syntactic predicates</a> 
and have no influence on the structure of the 
<a href="#TheParseTree">AST</a>. The names <i>not</i> and <i>guard</i> are inspired 
by functions of the same name and function in Scala's 
<a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/util/parsing/combinator/Parsers.html">Parsers</a>.
</p>

<p>
The second annotation is the <i>name</i> of the entity. The value displayed depends on the 
type of the node as described below.
</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
  <li>Root - the name of the parser-rule itself</li>
  <li>Literal - the name of the literal token</li>
  <li>Regexp - the name of the regular-expression token</li>
  <li>Reference - the name of referred-to parser-rule</li>
  <li>Choice - the description (see below) if defined</li>
  <li>Sequence - the description (see below) if defined</li>
  <li>RepSep - the description (see below) if defined</li>
  <li>Semantic predicate - the description (see below) if defined</li>
</ul>

<p>
All icons have at least the two annotations described above. All other annotations, 
described below, are optional. If any of the optional annotations are present, they are 
enclosed within square brackets.
</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
  <li>commit - backtracking to optional parser clauses (at an upper level) will be 
      prevented if this node is successfully parsed</li>
  <li>description - an optional user-assigned string (see below) that can be assigned 
      to certain types of node</li>
  <li>drop - the node will not be entered into the AST. You can see examples of 
      its use in the built-in <i>ArithExpr</i> <a href="SampleGrammars.html">Sample Grammars</a></li>
  <li>message - the node's associated error-message</li>
  <li>packrat - the parser-rule is a 
      <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/util/parsing/combinator/PackratParsers$PackratParser.html">packrat parser</a> 
      (applicable only to a root-node)</li>
  <li>trace - the parser's use of the node will be logged at run-time</li>
</ul>

<p>
All node attributes can be reviewed and changed via the context-menu as shown in 
Figure-5 above. 
</p>

<h4>Creating Rules</h4>

<p>
The grammar-tree popup menu is the tool used for creating and editing grammar-trees, 
and is described fully in 
<a href="http://vll.java.net/EditingTheGrammarTree.html">Editing the Grammar Tree</a>. 
In the following example we get our feet just a little wet by composing a simple rule 
with the <a href="#ManagingTokens">tokens we created above</a>. 
</p>

<p>
First, add a <i>Sequence</i> node to the grammar-tree by right-clicking the root node 
(<img src="images/GrammarIconRoot.gif" align="center" />) and selecting 
<i>Add -> Sequence</i> from the popup menu as shown on the left side of Figure-6 below. 
A sequence icon 
(<img src="images/GrammarIconSequence.gif" align="center" />) is added to the root, 
as on the right of the figure.
</p>

<p>
<img src="images/add-sequence.png" /><br/>
<em>Figure 6. Adding a sequence node</em>
</p>

<p>
Then perform the following steps:
</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>right-click the newly added sequence node 
    (<img src="images/GrammarIconSequence.gif" align="center" />) and select <i>Add -> Token</i>. 
    This will bring up a dialog containing a list of token names. 
    Select <i>NUMBER</i> and click the dialog's <i>OK</i> button. 
    A regex icon (<img src="images/GrammarIconRegex.gif" align="center" />) is added 
    to the sequence node</li> 
<li>right-click the sequence node again and select <i>Add -> Choice</i> from the popup menu. 
    This should add a <i>Choice</i> node icon 
    (<img src="images/GrammarIconChoice.gif" align="center" />) 
    to the sequence node</li>
<li>right-click the newly created choice node (<img src="images/GrammarIconChoice.gif" align="center" />) 
    and select <i>Add -> Token</i>. 
    Select <i>PLUS</i> in the dialog box and click <i>OK</i>. 
    A literal icon (<img src="images/GrammarIconLiteral.gif" align="center" />) 
    is added to the choice node. 
    Repeat this action once more, and add the <i>MUNUS</i> token to the choice node</li> 
<li>repeat the first step above to add another <i>NUMBER</i> to the sequence node</li>
</ul>

<p>
You're done! If your parser does not look like the one in Figure-7 below, 
use <i>Edit</i> from the grammar-tree's context menu to make the required changes. 
</p>

<p>
<img src="images/first-parser.png" /><br/>
<em>Figure 7. Your first visual parser</em>
</p>

<p>
The text displayed in the panel to the right of the grammar-tree is the 
<a href="#TheParseTree">AST</a> of the <i>selected</i> node, 
and so depends on which icon you clicked last. 
</p>

<h4>Miscellaneous Rule Operations</h4>

<p>
The main menu and toolbar also support several other operations. You can find which 
other rules refer any particular rule (<i>Rules -> Find rule</i>), 
rename rules (<i>Rules -> Rename rule</i>), and delete unused rules (<i>Rules -> Delete rule</i>). 
</p>

<h4 id="SavingTheGrammar">Saving the Grammar</h4>

<p>
A grammar can be saved to a file by invoking <i>File -> Save</i> from the main menu. 
Grammars are stored in XML files with a <i>.vll</i> suffix. 
The contained XML captures the structure of the rules, the token definitions, and 
other details, but no <a href="#GeneratedCode">generated code</a> of any kind. 
The XML is quite intuitive and you can use XSLT or a similar technology to 
transform it into another format 
(a grammar for another tool, or code of some sort, for example) if required.
</p>

<p>
A saved grammar can be read back into the GUI by invoking <i>File -> Open</i> from 
the main menu. This is useful for review, further editing, or testing. 
<a href="#UsingTheAPI">The API</a> can also load a saved grammar, 
and regenerate the parser for use from a client program.
</p>

<h3 id="TestingYourParser">Testing your Parser</h3>

<p>
Testing is really simple. Key in the test input under 
<i>Parser Test Input</i> (as at "A" in Figure-8 below), 
click the <i>Parse input</i> button (under the red rectangle), 
and validate the output that appears under <i>Parser Log</i> 
(at "C" in the figure). 
You don't have to write any code, use any other tools, or do anything else. 
</p>

<p>
<img src="images/testing-parser.png" /><br/>
<em>Figure 8. Testing your parser</em>
</p>

<p>
The figure shows the result of testing the parser with "3 + 5" 
as the input. 
The <i>Parser Log</i> are should contain the following text:
</p>

<pre><code>    Generating parsers ... (10 ms)
    Parsing ... (3 chars in 0 ms), result follows:
    <u>Array(3, Pair(0, +), 5)</u></code></pre>

<p>
The first two lines contain performance information that is safely ignored. 
The last line (underlined) is the parser's result. The result is an 
<a href="#TheParseTree">AST</a> 
with a predefined structure shown under <i>Parse Tree (AST) Structure</i>. 
Since the test input entered was "3 + 5", we <i>know</i> that the result is correct. 
However, real-life parsers are too complex for manual testing, so VisualLangLab supports 
several approaches to automated testing that are described online in 
<a href="http://vll.java.net/TestingParsers.html">Testing Parsers</a>. 
</p>

<p>
That brings us to the end of this quick example. If you feel that the result of 
parsing "3 + 5" should be 8 instead of <code>Array(3,Pair(0,+),5)</code> check out 
the section <i>ArithExpr with action-code</i> in 
<a href="http://vll.java.net/SampleGrammars.html">Sample Grammars</a>.
</p>

<h3 id="TheParseTree">The Parse-Tree (or AST)</h3>

<p>
The terms <i>parse-tree</i> and 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree">Abstract Syntax Tree</a> 
(or just <i>AST</i>) are used interchangeably to mean the 
structure of information gathered during the parsing process. 
VisualLangLab displays the AST of the selected grammar-tree node in the text area 
under <i>Parse Tree (AST) Structure</i> as seen in Figure-7 above. 
ASTs are constructed from mutually nested instances of certain standard Scala types, 
so a rudimentary understanding of their main features is useful. 
Examples and more details can be found online at 
<a href="http://vll.java.net/ASTAndActionCode.html">AST and Action Code</a> or 
in the downloaded zip.
</p>

<h3 id="ActionCode">Action Code</h3>

<p>
Action-code (or just <i>actions</i>) are Scala or Javascript 
functions associated with grammar-tree nodes, and entered into the text 
area under <i>Action Code</i> ("C" in <a href="#Figure2">Figure-2</a> above). 
It is <i>never</i> necessary to have action code embedded in the 
grammar &mdash; you can always remove all code into an application program that invokes 
the parser via the <a href="#UsingTheAPI">API</a>, and then processes the 
<a href="#TheParseTree">AST</a> returned by it. 
You can see examples of action-code in the <i>ArithExpr with action-code</i> 
<a href="#SampleGrammars">sample grammar</a>, and more details can be found online at 
<a href="http://vll.java.net/ASTAndActionCode.html">AST and Action Code</a> 
or in the downloaded zip.
</p>

<h3 id="UsingTheAPI">Using the API</h3>

<p>
The VisualLangLab API enables applications written in Scala (and Java with 
some awkwardness) to use parsers created with the GUI. The API is very small, 
and contains the types and functions required to perform the following 
operations.
</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
  <li>load a parser from a <a href="#SavingTheGrammar">saved grammar-file</a></li>
  <li>parse a string using the parser</li>
  <li>test the result, and retrieve the AST or error information</li>
</ul>

<p>
More details and examples can be found online at 
<a href="http://vll.java.net/UsingTheAPI.html">Using the API</a>. 
</p>

<h3 id="SampleGrammars">Sample Grammars</h3>

<p>
To enable users to quickly gain hands-on experience with VisualLangLab grammars, 
the tool contains some built-in sample grammars. These samples can be reviewed, 
tested, modified, and saved just like any other grammar created from scratch. 
To open a sample grammar select <i>Help -> Sample grammars</i> from the main 
menu, and choose one of the samples shown as in Figure-9 below.
</p>

<p>
<img src="images/SampleGrammar1.png" /><br/>
<em>Figure 9. Sample grammars available</em>
</p>

<p>
More information about these samples can be found online at 
<a href="http://vll.java.net/SampleGrammars.html">Sample Grammars</a> or 
in the downloaded zip file. 
</p>

<h3 id="DifferencesFromScala">Differences from Scala's Combinators</h3>

<p>
The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_diagram">class diagram</a> 
in Figure-10 below shows VisualLangLab's relationship with Scala's parser combinators.  
</p>

<p id="Figure10">
<img src="images/RelationshipWithScalaParserCombinators.png" /><br/>
<em>Figure 10. Relationship With Scala parser combinators</em>
</p>

<p>
However, the tool's classes override and augment a few key functionalities of the 
underlying Scala classes, so the behavior and AST of VisualLangLab's parsers 
is significantly different in certain ways. 
</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
  <li>The <i>Literal</i> and <i>Regex</i> node types use an internal 
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_analysis">lexical analyzer</a>, 
      and do not match input text in the same way 
      as <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/util/parsing/combinator/RegexParsers.html">RegexParsers</a>'s 
      <code>literal()</code> and <code>regex()</code> methods</li>
