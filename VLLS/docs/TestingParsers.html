    <h1>VisualLangLab - Testing Parsers</h1>

    <p>
      The greatest advantage of VisualLangLab over other tools is ease of testing. 
      Every other parser development tool requires 
      a quite complex code-generation step that must be completed without 
      errors before the parser can be run for testing. 
      But the grammar-tree in VisualLangLab is <i>executable</i> -- 
      meaning it can be run <i>directly</i> without any code-generation or 
      other manual activity. 
    </p>


    <h2>Validation is as Easy as A-B-C</h2>

    <p>
      Since the grammar-tree is <i>executable</i>, validation is just 
      three simple steps:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Enter test input in the <i>Parser Test Input</i> area (as at "A" 
          in Figure-1 below)</li>
      <li>Click the <i>Parse input</i> button (at "B" in Figure-1), 
          or select <i>Test -> Parse input</i> from the main menu</li>
      <li>Verify that the parser's output (at "C") is correct</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The approach shown above is tedious as it requires manual verification 
      of potentially complex data-structures. So while several approaches to 
      test automation will be described below, note that manual testing is 
      very useful during active development -- particularly to support an 
      iterative, incremental process.

    <h3>Providing Test Input from Files</h3>

    <p>
      Input for testing can also be obtained from a file instead of the 
      <i>Parser Test Input</i> area. To provide input from a file, 
      you should click the <i>Parse file</i> button 
      <img src="images/ToolBarButtonParseFile.gif" align="center" /> 
      (next to the <i>Parse input</i> button). 
      When the <i>Parse file</i> button is clicked a file-chooser dialog 
      is presented. Selecting a file and clicking the file-chooser's 
      <i>Open</i> button causes the parser to the run using text from 
      the file.
    </p>

    <p>
      If a directory is selected in the file-chooser dialog, 
      the grammar-tree is run on each of the files found in 
      the directory tree rooted at the selected directory. 
    </p>

    <h3>Terminating a Long Running Test</h3>

    <p>
      While a parser is being run the <i>Stop parsing</i> button 
      <img src="images/ToolBarButtonStopRun.gif" align="center" /> 
      is enabled. This is not noticed during a typical test as the 
      run ends very quickly, and the button returns to its usual 
      disabled state. However, a test run that appears to be running 
      for too long can be terminated by clicking this button.
