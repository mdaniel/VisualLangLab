    <p>
      The following sections describe the two distinct roles (and skills)
      of VisualLangLab users and the workflow that connects their activities. 
      The same individual could (and perhaps typically will) of course perform 
      both roles.

    <p>
      Before proceeding any further, readers should note 
      the following definitions.
    </p>

    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
      <li><u>action-code</u>: a function literal, coded in Javascript or Scala, associated with 
          any grammar-tree node (also known as <i>semantic action</i> or just <i>action</i> in 
          CS theory). The function is executed when 
          <a href="http://vll.java.net/">VisualLangLab</a> matches parser input to the node. 
          more details can be found in <a href="ASTAndActionCode.html">AST and Action Code.html</a></li>
      <li><u>grammar-file</u>: a XML file containing parsers developed with the VisualLangLab 
          GUI. These files do not contain any code -- just a description of all the 
          parser-specific information available to the GUI. The format of a grammar-file is very 
          intuitive, and it should be easy to use <i>XSLT</i> or something similar to translate 
          it into code or other form</li>
      <li><u>grammar-tree</u>: the visual tree that is used to display a parser-rule at the 
          top left of <a href="TheGUI.html">The GUI</a>. To the GUI user
          <i>the grammar-tree is the parser-rule</i> and there is no other user-accessible 
          form of the parser-rule. Because of this, <i>grammar-tree</i> and <i>parser-rule</i> 
          are used interchangably in the documentation. 
      <li><u>parser</u>: generally used to refer to a program or body of code that parses 
          text in a particular format (or <i>grammar</i>), <u>but see note below</u>. <a href="TheGUI.html">The GUI</a> itself is  
          a parser because it can parse text when <a href="TestingParsers.html">Testing Parsers</a>. 
          An application program that loads a grammar-file by <a href="UsingTheAPI.html">Using the API</a> is also a parser.</li>
      <li><u>parser-rule</u>: non-trivial parsers are simplified by breaking them down 
          into a number of simpler parser-rules (sometimes also called parser-predicates), 
          <u>but see note below</u>. 
          Each parser-rule is known by a unique name, and one of the parser-rules must be  
          distinguished as the top-level (entry-point) entity</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      <u>Note</u>: Readers, particularly those who will be <a href="UsingTheAPI.html">Using the API</a>, 
      should be aware that Scala's 

      <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/util/parsing/combinator/package.html">parser combinators</a> 
      (which VisualLangLab uses internally) assigns a type called <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/util/parsing/combinator/Parsers$Parser.html">Parser</a> 
      to parser-rules (and even the nodes that comprise them). VisualLangLab documentation however avoids using 
      that meaning of <i>parser</i>, preferring the definition given above instead. 
      So, be careful when reading <a href="UsingTheAPI.html">Using the API</a> which has to use both 
      the meanings. 
      The <a href="RelationshipWithScalaParserCombinators.html">Relationship with Scala Parser Combinators</a> 
      has more details.

    <h3 id="GrammarDomainExpert">Grammar/Domain Expert</h3>

    <p>
      The grammar expert is responsible for developing and testing a parser. 
      From the grammar expert's point of view, a <i>parser</i> is not an 
      application or piece of code, 
      but an XML file containing a specification from which code may be produced. 
      This parser is saved as an XML file (with suffix <i>vll</i>) that can 
      be published for use by application developers. The grammar files can 
      also be reopened in the IDE for reviewing, testing, or modification. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Anyone with a knowledge of parsing concepts (and an understanding of the 
      target grammar) can be trained to develop 
      and test parsers using the interface described in 
      <a href="TheGUI.html">The GUI</a>. 
      Manual testing, following prescribed test cases, 
      is also possible without knowledge of programming. Development of 
      automated test cases (e.g. using Javascript action-code or JUnit) 
      however does require knowledge of programming, and is described in 
      <a href="TestingParsers.html">Testing Parsers</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href="TheGUI.html">The GUI</a> (the grammar editor) 
      can be run by following the instructions in 
      <a href="DownloadInstallAndRun.html">Download Install and Run</a>, and 
      a grammar can be created or edited by following the instructions in 
      <a href="EditingTheGrammarTree.html">Editing the Grammar Tree</a>.
      An understanding of the <a href="RelationshipWithScalaParserCombinators.html">Relationship 
      with Scala Parser Combinators</a> provides a bridge to the Application developer's 
      perspective.  
    </p>

    <h3 id="ApplicationDeveloper">Application Developer</h3>

    <p>
      An application developer uses already available grammar files to create 
      applications for specific requirements. While an applicaion developer 
      may use <a href="TheGUI.html">The GUI</a> to understand and review the grammar, 
      his primary focus is <a href="UsingTheAPI.html">Using the API</a> and the 
      description of the <a href="ASTAndActionCode.html">AST and Action Code</a>. 
    </p>

    <p>
      An application developer also needs to be an expert in the use of programming 
      tools, have a good understanding of <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a>, 
      and have access to a domain expert 
      who understands the application's requirements well.
    </p>

    <h3 id="ApplicationUser">Application User</h3>

    <p>
      The Application user is typically unaware of the constituents of his 
      dedicated application, and the process that was used to design and 
      develop it. The VisualLangLab runtime library and one or more grammar files 
      are embedded in the product, 
      and depending on the nature or purpose of the application it may or 
      may not be necessary for the user to be aware of these factors.
    </p>

    <h2 id="QuickStart">Quick Start</h2>

    <p>
      The good way to quickly get an understand of VisualLangLab is to 
      start up the IDE, review and modify the <a href="SampleGrammars.html">Sample Grammars</a> 
      and <a href="TestingParsers.html">test the parsers</a>.
