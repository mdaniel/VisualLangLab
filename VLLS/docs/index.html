    <h1>VisualLangLab - An IDE for Parser Development</h1>
    <p>
      <a href="http://vll.java.net/">VisualLangLab</a> 
      is a completely visual IDE for development of parsers without 
      code or script of any kind. It is simple in use, and very easy to learn. 
      A grammar is represented as a tree with distinct icons for the grammar elements. 
      The following figures show how it represents the three parts of the arithmetic 
      expression parser in <a href="http://lamp.epfl.ch/teaching/foundations_of_software/docs/combinator_parsing.pdf">section 31.1</a> 
      of <a href="http://www.artima.com/shop/programming_in_scala">Programming in Scala (first edition)</a>. 
      The icons and annotations are explained fully in <a href="EditingTheGrammarTree.html">Editing the Grammar Tree</a>.
    </p>
    <table border="1">
      <tr><td>expr</td><td>factor</td><td>term</td></tr>
      <tr><td><img src="images/GrammarTreeExpr1.png"/></td><td><img src="images/GrammarTreeFactor1.png"/></td><td><img src="images/GrammarTreeTerm1.png"/></td></tr>
    </table>
    <p>
      The grammar tree is executable, and can be run at any time at the click of a button 
      -- without delay or further manual intervention. 
      Test input for the parser can be entered directly into the IDE or obtained 
      from user-specified files. Running the parser does not require any other tools or skills. 
      This capability simplifies testing, and encourages the use of an incremental, iterative 
      development process.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parser development is reduced to editing the tree's structure using the mouse 
      for menu-bar and context-menu operations. 
      Textual input from the keyboard is required only for naming parsers and tokens, 
      and for specifying regular expression patterns for tokens. 
      The user-interface is explained fully in <a href="TheGUI.html">The Gui</a> and 
      <a href="EditingTheGrammarTree.html">Editing the Grammar Tree</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The grammar is saved as an intuitive XML file that can be loaded again later 
      for further editing and testing. 
      An API is also available for client programs (in Scala or Java) to load the 
      saved XML file and regenerate the parser. 
      Parser regeneration happens on the fly, (when the XML file-name is passed to the API) 
      and does not require any intermediate steps or other manual intervention. 
      Further details and examples can be found in <a href="UsingTheAPI.html">Using the API</a>.

    <h2>Download, Installation, and Running</h2>
      <p>
        Full information can be found <a href="DownloadInstallAndRun.html">here</a>.
      </p>
    <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
    <p>
      Beginning version 3.01 (July 2011), Scala 2.9.0+ is required. If required, you can download 
      Scala from <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/downloads">here</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>History</h2>
      <p>
        <a href="http://vll.java.net/">VisualLangLab</a> 
        was born on 5<sup>th</sup> March 2004 as <i>A Visual LL(K) Parser Generator</i>.
        This first version was written in Java, and can still be found <a href="http://java.net/projects/a-visual-llk-parser-generator">here</a>. 
        The software was usable by mid-2004, 
        and an interesting application is described in <a href="http://today.java.net/pub/a/today/2004/10/06/compiler.html">this java.net article</a> 
        published in early October 2004.
      </p>
      <p>
        The availability of Scala and its built-in parser-combinators prompted a re-write, 
        and a Scala version was published under this java.net project on 10th March 2010. 
        Although all of the code was re-written (in Scala), 
        the essential character of the GUI remained the same.
