  <h1>VisualLangLab - A visual IDE for Parser Development</h1>

  <p><a href="http://vll.java.net/">VisualLangLab</a> is a completely visual IDE for
  development of parsers without code or script of any kind. It is simple in use, and
  very easy to learn. 
  Parser rules are represented as <i>grammar trees</i> with distinct icons for the grammar elements. 
  The following figures show how it represents the rules of the
  arithmetic expression parser in <a href=
  "http://lamp.epfl.ch/teaching/foundations_of_software/docs/combinator_parsing.pdf">section
  31.1</a> of <a href="http://www.artima.com/shop/programming_in_scala">Programming in
  Scala</a>. The icons and annotations are explained fully in <a href=
  "EditingTheGrammarTree.html">Editing the Grammar Tree</a>.</p>

  <table border="1">
    <tr>
      <td>expr</td>

      <td>factor</td>

      <td>term</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td><img src="images/GrammarTreeExpr1.png" /></td>

      <td><img src="images/GrammarTreeFactor1.png" /></td>

      <td><img src="images/GrammarTreeTerm1.png" /></td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>Grammar trees are executable, and can be run at any time at the click of a button
  -- without delay or further manual intervention. Test input for the parser can be
  entered directly into the IDE or obtained from user-specified files. Running the parser
  does not require any other tools or skills. This capability simplifies testing, and
  encourages the use of an incremental, iterative development process.</p>

  <p>Parser development is reduced to creating the required grammar trees using the mouse for
  menu-bar and context-menu operations. Textual input from the keyboard is required only
  for naming the parser rules and tokens, and for specifying regular expression patterns for
  tokens. The user-interface is explained fully in <a href="TheGUI.html">The Gui</a> and
  <a href="EditingTheGrammarTree.html">Editing the Grammar Tree</a>.</p>

  <p>The grammar is saved as a XML file that can be reloaded for further editing and testing. 
  An API enables client programs (in Scala, Javascript or  Java) 
  to load the XML file and regenerate the parser. Parser regeneration happens
  on the fly, (when the XML file-name is passed to the API) and does not require any
  intermediate manual intervention. Further details and examples can be
  found in <a href="UsingTheAPI.html">Using the API</a>.</p>

  <h2>Download, Installation, and Running</h2>

  <p>Full information can be found <a href="DownloadInstallAndRun.html">here</a>.</p>

  <h2>Prerequisites</h2>

  <p>Beginning version 3.01 (July 2011), Scala 2.9.0+ is required. If required, you can
  download Scala from <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/downloads">here</a>.</p>

  <p>Although VisualLangLab uses Scala's 
  <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/util/parsing/combinator/package.html">parser combinators</a> internally, 
  the user does not have to know any programming language or parser generation tool. 
  Advanced users may, however, provide action-code snippets 
  (as standalone Javascript or Scala functions) to augment testing effectiveness.</p>

  <h2>History</h2>

  <p><a href="http://vll.java.net/">VisualLangLab</a> was born on 5<sup>th</sup> March
  2004 as <i>A Visual LL(K) Parser Generator</i>. This first version was written in Java,
  and can still be found <a href=
  "http://java.net/projects/a-visual-llk-parser-generator">here</a>. The software was
  usable by mid-2004, and an interesting application is described in <a href=
  "http://today.java.net/pub/a/today/2004/10/06/compiler.html">this java.net article</a>
  published in early October 2004.</p>

  <p>The availability of Scala and its built-in parser-combinators prompted a re-write,
  and a Scala version was published under this java.net project on 10th March 2010.
  Although all of the code was re-written (in Scala), the essential character of the GUI
  remains the same.</p>
