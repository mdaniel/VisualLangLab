    <h1>VisualLangLab - Relationship with Scala Parser Combinators</h1>

    <p>
      The UML class diagram in Figure-1 below is an abstraction of 
      VisualLangLab's relationship with Scala's 
      <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/util/parsing/combinator/package.html">parser combinators</a>. 
    </p>

    </p>

    <p>
      The GUI owns an instance of the class <code>VLLParsers</code> which extends  
      <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/util/parsing/combinator/Parsers.html">Parsers</a> with 
      <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/util/parsing/combinator/PackratParsers.html">PackratParsers</a>, 
      and the grammar-trees effectively become members of that instance as though defined as follows: 
    </p> 

<pre><code>    lazy val aParser: <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/util/parsing/combinator/Parsers$Parser.html">scala.util.parsing.combinator.Parser</a>[Any] = ...</code></pre>

    <p>
      However, because of the way Scala's 
      <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/util/parsing/combinator/package.html">parser combinators</a> 
      work, it is not necessary to generate or compile any code under the hood. 
    </p> 

    <p>
      In terms of the <i>Essential Jargon</i> in the 
      <a href="UserGuide.html">User Guide</a>, the GUI 
      (by owning an instance of <code>VLLParsers</code>) is a <i>parser</i>, while 
      members like <code>aParser</code> are <i>parser-rule</i>s that 
      bring <i>grammar-tree</i>s to life. The line of Scala 
      code above shows that <code>aParser</code> is of type 
      <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/util/parsing/combinator/Parsers$Parser.html">Parser</a> 
      which of course is different from the idea of <i>parser</i> in the <i>Essential Jargon</i>. 
      The spelling of the two terms has a subtle difference -- the case of the inital 
      letter. In the rest of this document we will use <i>Parser</i> (with an 
      initial capital) consistently to mean Scala's
      <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/util/parsing/combinator/Parsers$Parser.html">Parser</a>, 
      not the <i>Essential Jargon</i>'s <i>parser</i>. 
    </p> 

    <p>
      This abstraction is not 100% technically accurate, but represents the 
      capabilities and functions of the resulting assembly well. 
      More details, along with a programming-level view 
      can be found in <a href="UsingTheAPI.html">Using the API</a>

    <h2>Grammar-Tree to Parser-Rule</h2>

    <p>
      The toolkit that enables VisualLangLab to produce a <i>parser-rule</i> from information 
      in a <i>grammar-tree</i> is the set of methods of the classes <code>Parsers</code>, 
      <code>PackratParsers</code>, and <code>Parser</code> as augmented by 
      the methods in <code>Parsers</code>. The following description highlights the 
      significant changes made by VisualLangLab. 
    </p>

    <h3>Sequence Node vs "~" Combinator</h3>

    <p>
      The Sequence node is converted into a 
      <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/util/parsing/combinator/Parsers$Parser.html">Parser</a> 
      that returns an <code>Array[Any]</code> instead of instances of 
      the class named "~". Arrays are simpler to handle, and lead to less complex code 
      in actions or application programs (see examples in 
      <a href="UsingTheAPI.html">Using the API</a>). A 
      <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/util/parsing/combinator/Parsers$Parser.html">Parser</a> 
      produced from a Sequence node also handles the <i>drop</i> annotation 
      on child nodes, combining the child nodes with the "<~", "~>", and "~" functions 
      as required. The generated 
      <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/util/parsing/combinator/Parsers$Parser.html">Parser</a> 
      also handles the <i>commit</i> annotation on a child node.
    </p> 

    <h3>Choice Node vs "|" Combinator</h3>

    <p>
      The Choice node is converted into a 
      <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/util/parsing/combinator/Parsers$Parser.html">Parser</a> 
      that returns a <code>Pair[Int,Any]</code>. The first member is a 
      (0-based) index of the matching alternative. 
      This is the key to developing the parser separately from AST handling code 
      (see examples in <a href="UsingTheAPI.html">Using the API</a>). 
      Developers using the Scala API's "|" combinator directly can not separate the 
      parser from action-code and <i>must</i> provide some 
      action code co-located with each alternative. 
    </p> 

    <h3>Trace Annotation vs log()</h3>

    <p>
      VisualLangLab provides a <i>trace</i> annotation 
      (see <a href="EditingTheGrammarTree.html">Editing the Grammar Tree</a>) that 
      allows you to conveniently enable tracing of any parser-rule or part of a 
      parser-rule. The output generated by this facility is properly indented 
      to indicate nesting of traced levels, and is more helpful than the <code>log()</code> method in 
      <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/util/parsing/combinator/Parsers.html">Parsers</a>. 
      The <i>trace</i> annotation on any grammar-tree node is toggled by using the grammar-tree's pop-up context menu.
    </p> 

    <h3>Node Names</h3>

    <p>
      VisualLangLab gives every grammar-tree node a unique name based on the name of the 
      <i>parser-rule</i> and the node's position in the tree (see Figure-2 below). 
      The names are used for identifying nodes in error reports or trace logs. 
      To reduce clutter <a href="TheGUI.html">The GUI</a> does not normally display node names, 
      but they can be made visible by selecting <i>View -> Full names</i> from the main menu. 
    </p>

    <h2>The Built-In Lexer</h2>

    <p>
      VisualLangLab does not depend on 
      <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/util/parsing/combinator/RegexParsers.html">RegexParsers</a>, 
      but provides its own lexer-like capabilities for handling tokens (literal and regex), whitespace, and comments. 
      More information on this aspect is given below. 
    </p> 

    <p>
      Parsers that use tokens defined with regular-expression patterns are typically based on 
      <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/util/parsing/combinator/RegexParsers.html">RegexParsers</a>. 
      Unfortunately, this class does not really use a lexer, and the <code>Parser</code>s 
      produced by its <i>literal(String)</i> and <i>regex(Regex)</i> methods do not behave 
      as sometimes required (or expected). Because of this, VisualLangLab uses its own 
      internal lexer -- simple and somewhat slow, but functions as lexers normally do. 
    </p> 

    <h3>Whitespace and Comments</h3>

    <p>
      Although 
      <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/util/parsing/combinator/RegexParsers.html">RegexParsers</a> 
      is not used, a similar mechanism is used for handling whitespace and comments. 
      More details can be found in <a href="EditingTheGrammarTree.html">Editing the Grammar Tree</a>.
    </p> 

    <h2>Error Checking</h2>

    <p>
      <a href="TheGUI.html">The GUI</a> checks all parser-rules for certain types of errors, 
      and will flag offending grammar-tree nodes by overlaying them with the error mark 
      (<img src="images/GrammarIconErrorMark.gif" align="center" />). 
      The tool-tip text of the node is altered to indicate the source of the problem. 
      The following types of error are detected:
    </p> 

    <h3>Parser-Rules that Match the Empty String</h3>

    <p>
      Using parser-rules that can match the empty string can lead to difficult-to-fix 
      problems. Redesign your grammar to use multiplicity in a suitable way and avoid 
      the need for such parser-rules. 
    </p> 

    <h3>Nodes with Bad Action-Code</h3>

    <p>
      Action code associated with any grammar-tree node 
      (see <a href="ASTAndActionCode.html">AST and Action Code</a>) is checked for correct 
      syntax, and any errors are flagged.
