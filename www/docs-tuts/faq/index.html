<p id="choice">
The "Choice" node type is transformed into multiple invocations of the "|" combinator. 
In effect, all the child nodes of a Sequence are combined together with applications 
of "|". Thus, a Choice node that has x, y, and z as child nodes effectively represents 
the parser "(x | y | z)". The name "Choice" has no relationship to any 
classes in the Scala API. 
</p>

<p id="downloading">
You can download the VisualLangLab JAR <a href="https://vll.dev.java.net/VisualLangLab.jar">here</a>
</p>

<p id="editing-parser-tree">
You can edit the parser-node by right-clicking the node and choosing "Edit" from the context 
menu. The sub-menu under "Edit" allows you to move the node up or down (relative to its 
siblings), and also to cut, copy, paste, and delete the selected node.
</p>

<p id="error-message">
You assign a (custom) error-message to a parse-tree node by right-clicking it and choosing 
"Error message" from the context menu. Then enter the message text into the dialog box presented. 
</p>

<p id="literal-creating">
You create a Literal token by choosing <i>Tokens -> New literal</i> from the main menu. 
Then enter literal-name, a comma, and the literal-value into the dialog box presented. 
For example, to create a Literal called "DASH" for the character "-", enter "DASH,-" 
(without the quotes) into the dialog. You can add blanks around the comma if you wish. 
</p>

<p id="multiplicity-setting">
You set the multiplicity of a node in the parser tree by right-clicking the node and 
choosing <i>Multiplicity -> ?</i> from the context menu. The "?" in the preceding 
sentence represents any of the options availabile (1, *, +, ?, and 0). 
</p>

<p id="multiplicity-value-0">
Setting Multiplicity to 0 means that matching data must not exist in the input. 
VisualLangLab implements this feature with the "not" combinator. 
</p>

<p id="parser-create">
You create a new parser by choosing "Parsers -> New parser" from the main menu, and 
entering the parser name into the dialog box presented. This creates (and displays) 
a newly created parser with just a root node. You can then proceed to build the complete 
parser by right-clicking the root-node, and choosing "Add" from the context menu. 
For the simplest possible parser you would add a token (a previously created 
Literal or a Regex) directly to the root-node. But more typically you would add one 
of the aggregate types (Sequence, Choice, or RepSep) to the root-node. You would then 
recursively add further elements to that parser-tree till the parser is fully defined. 
</p>

<p id="regex-creating">
You create a Regex token by choosing <i>Tokens -> New regex</i> from the main menu. 
Then enter regex-name, a comma, and the regex-pattern into the dialog box presented. 
For example, to create a Regex called "INT" for the pattern "\d+", enter "INT,\d+" 
(without the quotes) into the dialog. You can add blanks around the comma if you wish. 
</p>

<p id="rep1sep">
The "RepSep" node can perform the function of both combinators "repsep" and "rep1sep". 
Which one it emulates depends on the multiplicity setting. A multiplicity setting of "*" 
gives the "repsep" behavior, while a setting of "+" gives the "rep1sep" behavior.
</p>

<p id="running">
You run VisualLangLab by executing the following command line: 
</p>
<pre>scala -cp VisualLangLab.jar net.java.dev.vll.VisualLangLab</pre>
<p>
You must have Scala 2.8 installed. VisualLangLab has been tested on Windows-XP 
and Linux (Ubuntu 9.10) 
</p>

<p id="sequence">
The "Sequence" node type is transformed into multiple invocations of the "~" combinator. 
In effect, all the child nodes of a Sequence are threaded together with applications 
of "~". Thus, a Sequence that has a, b, and c as child nodes effectively represents 
the parser "(a ~ b ~ c)". The name "Sequence" has no relationship to similarly named 
classes in the Scala API. 
</p>

<p id="tracing">
You can enable (or disable) tracing of a parser-node by right-clicking the node and choosing "Trace" 
from the context menu. When tracing is enabled on a node, VisualLangLab prints a trace message 
whenever the trace-enabled node is used (successfully or otherwise) in the course of a parser run. 
</p>

<p id="troubleshooting">
There are two features that help in troubleshooting a parser -- <a href="#tracing">tracing</a> 
and custom <a href="#error-message">error messages</a>.
</p>
