<h3 id="choice">How is "Choice" related to Scala types?</h3>
The "Choice" node type is transformed into multiple invocations of the "|" combinator. 
In effect, all the child nodes of a Sequence are combined together with applications 
of "|". Thus, a Choice node that has x, y, and z as child nodes effectively represents 
the parser "(x | y | z)". The name "Choice" has no relationship to any 
classes in the Scala API. 


<h3 id="code-generated">Where is the generated code?</h3>
While you can use VisualLangLab to visually model a parser and also test-run it, 
the generated code option has not yet been completed. 
VisualLangLab does not need to generate or compile any code for its own purposes -- 
which is how it is able to run the created parser. 
"Creating a parser" in the VisualLangLab context really means just visually modeling it!


<h3 id="combinator-related">How are these concepts related to Scala combinators?</h3>
Though not the whole truth, it is useful to believe that the GUI is derived from 
"scala.util.parsing.combinator.Parsers", and that the trees are related to "Parsers.Parser"


<h3 id="downloading">Where can I download VisualLangLab from?</h3>
You can download the VisualLangLab JAR <a href="https://vll.dev.java.net/VisualLangLab.jar">here</a>


<h3 id="editing-grammar-tree">How do I edit a grammar-node?</h3>
You can edit a grammar-node by right-clicking the node and choosing "Edit" from the context 
menu. The sub-menu under "Edit" allows you to move the node up or down (relative to its 
siblings), and also to cut, copy, paste, and delete the selected node.


<h3 id="error-message">How do I assign a custom error message to a grammar-node?</h3>
You assign a (custom) error-message to a grammar-tree node by right-clicking it and choosing 
"Error message" from the context menu. Then enter the message text into the dialog box presented. 


<h3 id="flattening">What is "flattening"?</h3>
You instruct VisualLangLab to flatten all nested "~" objects by choosing "Run -> Flatten nested ~" 
from the main menu. When flattening has been enabled in this way, VisualLangLab translates each 
nested "~" object (in the parse-tree) into a Scala Array. This makes life easier for the 
parse-tree processor. 


<h3 id="literal-creating">How do I create a Literal token?</h3>
You create a Literal token by choosing <i>Tokens -> New literal</i> from the main menu. 
Then enter literal-name, a comma, and the literal-value into the dialog box presented. 
For example, to create a Literal called "DASH" for the character "-", enter "DASH,-" 
(without the quotes) into the dialog. You can add blanks around the comma if you wish. 


<h3 id="multiplicity-setting">How do I set the multiplicity of a grammar node?</h3>
You set the multiplicity of a node in the grammar-tree by right-clicking the node and 
choosing <i>Multiplicity -> ?</i> from the context menu. The "?" in the preceding 
sentence represents any of the options availabile (1, *, +, ?, and 0). 


<h3 id="multiplicity-value-0">Why/when would I set multiplicty to 0 (zero)?</h3>
Setting Multiplicity to 0 means that matching data must not exist in the input. 
Check documentation about the "not" combinator. 


<h3 id="parser-create">How do I create a parser?</h3>
You create a new parser by choosing "Parsers -> New parser" from the main menu, and 
entering the parser name into the dialog box presented. This creates (and displays) 
a newly created parser with just a root node. You can then proceed to build the complete 
parser by right-clicking the root-node, and choosing "Add" from the context menu. 
For the simplest possible parser you would add a token (a previously created 
Literal or a Regex) directly to the root-node. But more typically you would add one 
of the aggregate types (Sequence, Choice, or RepSep) to the root-node. You would then 
recursively add further elements to that grammar-tree till the parser is fully defined. 


<h3 id="regex-creating">How do I create a Regex token</h3>
You create a Regex token by choosing <i>Tokens -> New regex</i> from the main menu. 
Then enter regex-name, a comma, and the regex-pattern into the dialog box presented. 
For example, to create a Regex called "INT" for the pattern "\d+", enter "INT,\d+" 
(without the quotes) into the dialog. You can add blanks around the comma if you wish. 


<h3 id="rep1sep">Why is there no Rep1Sep?</h3>
The "RepSep" node can perform the function of both combinators "repsep" and "rep1sep". 
Which one it emulates depends on the multiplicity setting. A multiplicity setting of "*" 
gives the "repsep" behavior, while a setting of "+" gives the "rep1sep" behavior.


<h3 id="running">How do I run VisualLangLab?</h3>
You run VisualLangLab by executing the following command line: 

<pre>scala -cp VisualLangLab.jar net.java.dev.vll.VisualLangLab</pre>

You must have Scala 2.8 installed. VisualLangLab has been tested on Windows-XP 
and Linux (Ubuntu 9.10) 


<h3 id="running-parser">How do I run the parser?</h3>
You run the created parser by pasting the input text into the "Parser input" area, and 
then choosing "Run -> Run parser" from the main menu. Remember to have the top-level 
parser selected in the tree-display when you invoke "Run -> Run parser". Running the 
parser without any text in the "Parser input" area passes an empty string ("") to 
the parser.


<h3 id="sample-parser">Where can I find sample parsers?</h3>
A few sample parsers are bundled with VisualLangLab. Choose "Help -> Samples" from the 
main menu. Other samples can be found 
<a href="https://vll.dev.java.net/grammars/index.html">here</a>.


<h3 id="sequence">How is "Sequence" related to other Scala types?</h3>
The "Sequence" node type is transformed into multiple invocations of the "~" combinator. 
In effect, all the child nodes of a Sequence are threaded together with applications 
of "~". Thus, a Sequence that has a, b, and c as child nodes effectively represents 
the parser "(a ~ b ~ c)". The name "Sequence" has no relationship to similarly named 
classes in the Scala API. 


<h3 id="tracing">How can I get a run-time trace of a grammar-node?</h3>
You can enable (or disable) tracing of a grammar-node by right-clicking the node and choosing "Trace" 
from the context menu. When tracing is enabled on a node, VisualLangLab prints a trace message 
whenever the trace-enabled node is used (successfully or otherwise) in the course of a parser run. 


<h3 id="troubleshooting">How do I troubleshoot a parser?</h3>
There are two features that help in troubleshooting a parser -- <a href="#tracing">tracing</a> 
and custom <a href="#error-message">error messages</a>.


<h3 id="website">Where is the VisualLangLab website?</h3>
The VisualLangLab web-site is here: https://vll.dev.java.net/
