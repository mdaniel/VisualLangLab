<p id="error-message">
You assign a (custom) error-message to a parse-tree node by right-clicking it and choosing 
"Error message" from the context menu. Then enter the message text into the dialog box presented. 
</p>

<p id="literal-creating">
You create a Literal token by choosing <i>Tokens -> New literal</i> from the main menu. 
Then enter literal-name, a comma, and the literal-value into the dialog box presented. 
For example, to create a Literal called "DASH" for the character "-", enter "DASH,-" 
(without the quotes) into the dialog. You can add blanks around the comma if you wish. 
</p>

<p id="multiplicity-setting">
You set the multiplicity of a node in the parser tree by right-clicking the node and 
choosing <i>Multiplicity -> ?</i> from the context menu. The "?" in the preceding 
sentence represents any of the options availabile (1, *, +, ?, 0). 
</p>

<p id="multiplicity-value-0">
Setting Multiplicity to 0 means that matching data must not exist in the input. 
VisualLangLab implements this feature with the "not" combinator. 
</p>

<p id="regex-creating">
You create a Regex token by choosing <i>Tokens -> New regex</i> from the main menu. 
Then enter regex-name, a comma, and the regex-pattern into the dialog box presented. 
For example, to create a Regex called "INT" for the pattern "\d+", enter "INT,\d+" 
(without the quotes) into the dialog. You can add blanks around the comma if you wish. 
</p>

<p id="rep1sep">
The "RepSep" node can perform the function of both combinators "repsep" and "rep1sep". 
Which one it emulates depends on the multiplicity setting. A multiplicity setting of "*" 
gives the "repsep" behavior, while a setting of "+" gives the "rep1sep" behavior.
</p>

<p id="running">
You run VisualLangLab by executing the following command line: 
</p>
<pre>scala -cp VisualLangLab.jar net.java.dev.vll.VisualLangLab</pre>
<p>
You must have Scala 2.8 installed. VisualLangLab has been tested on Windows-XP 
and Linux (Ubuntu 9.10) 
</p>

<p id="sequence">
The "Sequence" node type is transformed into multiple invocations of "~" combinator. 
In effect, all the child nodes of a Sequence are threaded together with applications 
of "~". Thus, if a Sequence has a, b, and c as child nodes, it effectively becomes 
the parser "(a ~ b ~ c)". The name "Sequence" has no relationship to similarly named 
classes in the Scala API.
