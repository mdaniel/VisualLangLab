<h3>Project Description</h3>

<table width="100%"><tr>

<td>
<p>VisualLangLab is an IDE for creating, testing, and running LL(*) parsers using 
<a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala's</a> 
<a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/docu/files/api/scala/util/parsing/combinator/Parsers.Parser.html">
parser</a> 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parser_combinator">combinators</a> 
in a purely visual environment without code or <i>grammar</i> scripts of any kind. It is a rapid application development environment that enables you to quickly produce backtracking, recursive-descent LL(*) parsers without writing any code - and even without knowing how to program in 
Scala (well, almost). Parsers can be run and tested within the same environment.
</a>

<p>
Development with VisualLangLab is extremely fast as parser code-generation 
and compilation are not required. VisualLangLab uses Scala's parser 
combinator capabilities to build complex parsers on the fly at run-time, 
so an iterative, incremental design process works very well.

<h3>Downloading & running</h3>
<p>
You only need to download a single jar file: 
<a href="https://vll.dev.java.net/files/documents/10973/148678/VisualLangLab.jar">VisualLangLab.jar</a>. You start the program by executing the 
following command:
</p>

<code>scala -cp VisualLangLab.jar net.java.dev.vll.VisualLangLab</code>

<p>
You must have Scala 2.8 (currently a 
<a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/node/212/distributions">Beta pre-release</a>) installed. In turn, Scala 2.8 requires Java 1.5 or higher to be installed.
</p>

<p>
Alternatively, you can

<h3>Issues:</h3>
<p>To submit a project issue, or query existing issues, click <a href="servlets/ProjectIssues">here</a></p>

<p>
The current version (2.01) produces parsers based purely on 
<a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/archives/downloads/distrib/files/nightly/docs/library/index.html">RegexParsers</a>, 
but there are plans to include the benefits of 
<a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/archives/downloads/distrib/files/nightly/docs/library/index.html">PackratParsers</a> and other powerful features in future 
versions.
