VisualLangLab is a completely visual IDE for development of parsers
without code or scripts of any kind. It is simple to use, and easy to learn.
A grammar is represented as a tree with distinct icons for grammar elements.

The grammar tree is executable, and can be run at any time at the click of a 
button -- without delay or further manual intervention. 
Test input for the parser can be entered directly into the IDE or 
obtained from user-specified files. 
Running the parser does not require any other tools or skills. 
This capability simplifies testing, and encourages the use of an incremental, 
iterative development process.

Parser development is reduced to editing the tree's structure, 
using the mouse for menu-bar and context-menu operations. 
Textual input from the keyboard is required only for naming parsers and tokens, 
and for specifying regular expression patterns for tokens. 

The grammar is saved as a XML file that can be loaded again 
for further editing and/or testing. An API is also available for client programs 
(in any JVM language) to load the saved XML file and regenerate the parser.
Parser regeneration does not require generation or compilation of code.
