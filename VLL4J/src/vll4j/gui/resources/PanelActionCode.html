    Action-Code (or just <i>Action</i>) is a JavaScript function associated with <br/>
    any rule-tree node. Action-code functions are optional elements of a grammar <br/>
    used to modify the native AST of a rule-tree on the fly. <br/>
    A function used as Action-code has the following characteristics:<br/>
    <ul>
        <li>Takes one argument that receives the AST of the associated node.</li>
        <li>Returns the modified AST (or null).</li>
        <li>Is called twice: first unconditionally before parsing of the <br/>
            associated node begins, and again (only if parsing was successful) <br/>
            after parsing has been completed. The first call uses an argument value <br/>
            of null, while during the second call the argument contains the <br/>
            AST. </li>
    </ul>
