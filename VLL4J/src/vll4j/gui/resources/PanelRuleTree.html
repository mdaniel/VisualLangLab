    This area contains the rule-tree (the tree-structured graphical representation <br/>
    of a parser-rule used by VisualLangLab. The rule-tree also supports  <br/>
    context-menus for editing the rule-tree.  <br/>
    Examples of rule-trees can be seen by loading any of the sample grammars  <br/>
    found under "Help" -> "Sample grammars" -> ...<br/>
    Further details can be found at http://vll.java.net/EditingTheGrammarTree.html
